# Simple File Upload Server

This is a simple file upload server written in rust. Supports drag and drop / file selection for uploading. Build as a simple hobby project, since I wanted to try how to write HTTP, API's using Rust.

## Security

**WARNING**: Do not use in public / production environments. While I've fixed some vulnerabilities (such as path traversals and other bugs), there might still be large security issues that I've not noticed.
